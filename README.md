# Diettracker
This project is about creating an app using JAVA FX which will allow user to keep track of their diet. 

Following are the features available on this app:
1) User can put their information (gender, age in years, weight and height) and the app will suggests the recommended nutrients 
   (protein, iron, calcium, etc.) per day using USDA(United states department of Agriculture) data.
2) User can search for a product, what nutrients the product have. Alternatively, user can search for products which have a 
   particular nutrients. For example if the user search for protein, app will display all the products which have protein.
3) User can add a particular product in their diet and through visualisation can see how much of their daily nutrients need is
   successfully met by the product.
4) It allows user to add multiple products to their diet and help them to keep track of four nutrients(Energy, protein,
   carbohydrate, fiber).
